<!-- if you type a ! and press tab it will auto fill stuff u need for each file type, html looks like the above
Alt + shift + arrow keys duplicates a line of code
ctrl + space supposedly auto completes code but i didnt try it in time
alt+ arrows moves the line of code up or down
ctrl + shift + K deletes the line you hover, or all of the lines you mark

    <!-- <div> is one of the most used elements for website layouts
 Its used to group and structure the websites contents into divided areas.
 Used with css.


Id = #
Id is used to make bookmarks in HTML code
Its used by css and javascript to 
kinda like a function in Python
but for some reason its supposed to be used only once for compatability?
functions seem to actually be more like classes

    <title> Example for ID</title>
    <style>
        #GreenFantasy {
            color:green;
            font-size: 100px;
            text-align: center;
            font-family: fantasy;
        }

<!-- Classes are used by css and javascript to pick one or several specific elements.
    One css class can be used by several html elements on a page 
head -> style -> css code
-->
<head>
    <style>
        .tomato {
            background-color: red;
            color:white;
            text-align: center;
        }
        .banana {
            font-family: serif;
            color:orange;
            background-color: aqua;
            
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="tomato">
        <h1> This is tomato class</h1>
    </div>

    <p> Random text in between to show how divs work</p>

    <div class="banana">
        <h1> This is banana class</h1>

    </div>
    <div class="tomato banana">
        <p> This has both classes </p>
    </div>
</body>
<!-- So classes can be used infinite like a function in python
here we make a div to make a segment that uses the class city
and then all elements inside of the div will use the class city as its settings
therefore everything will have a red background with white test
So here we have two different classes in two different divs with some text in between
the divs that then dont get the attributes of the classes. As well as another that uses both classes!
If there are confliciting attributes in the classes it will take the latter one. Like the last code that
gets read.
